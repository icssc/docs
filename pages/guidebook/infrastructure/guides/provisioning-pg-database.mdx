</Callout>

Create a Postgres database within our RDS database server, with the owner being the `postgres` user.

### Creating Roles and Users

The `<project>_dev` group is the parent group of devs and should be created with READ, WRITE, and EXECUTE permissions on the dev / public schema.

#### `<project>_lead` Group

**This group should exist for all databases.**

This is the parent group that project leads' database users inherit their permission from.

#### `<project>_prod` User

**This group should exist for all databases.**

This is the databse user used to connect from the production deployment.
