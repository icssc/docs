</Callout>

## Setup

<Steps>
### Clone Repository
 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/icssc/corporate-dashboard.git
cd corporate-dashboard
```
 
### Install Dependencies

<Callout type="warning">
  This project uses pnpm. Use pnpm to install dependencies to avoid mismatching lockfiles.
</Callout>

### Setup IAM Credentials _Optional_

This is an optional step only available for ICSSC Projects internal members. If this is your first time setting up an ICSSC project using SST, request credentials from your project lead. If you've already set up IAM Credentials for another ICSSC project, this step is not necessary.

```
[default]
aws_access_key_id = <YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID>
aws_secret_access_key = <YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>
```

</Steps>

## Commands

### Dev

#### With SST

```bash
pnpm dev
```

#### Without SST

```bash
pnpm exec next dev
```

### Build

```bash
pnpm build
```
