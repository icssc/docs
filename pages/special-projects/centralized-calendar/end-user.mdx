## FAQ

### How do event updates work?

Once your calendar link is submitted and integrated into the ics-centralized-calendar, your events will be automatically updated every 6 hours. This ensures that any new events or changes to existing events that have not happened yet are reflected in the ics-centralized-calendar quickly.

### What event information is required?

Every event should have the following fields for best clarity and organization, these fields are usually required by default when creating an event in Google Calendar:

- **Title:** A clear description of the event.
- **Date and Time:** A start and end time that is input through the google calendar GUI.
- **Description:** Include details such as location, agenda, and contact information.

### How can I make changes to my events?

Simply update your events in your Google Calendar. The changes will be reflected in the ics-centralized-calendar during the next update cycle.

### How do I change or remove my club's calendar from the centralized calendar?

Contact our project leads([Alex](https://github.com/alexanderl19), [Eddy](https://github.com/ecxyzzy)) to change or remove your calendar URL from the ics-centralized-calendar.
