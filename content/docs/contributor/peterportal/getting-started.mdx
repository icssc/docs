This document will guide you through setting up the project on your local machine, from cloning the repository to running the project locally. Whether you're a committee member or an open-source contributor, you'll find all the necessary steps to get started below.

## Setup

<Steps>
<Step>
### Cloning the Repository

#### For Committee Members

1. Clone the repository using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/icssc/peterportal-client
   ```

2. Navigate into the cloned repository:

   ```bash
   cd peterportal-client
   ```

#### For Open Source Contributors

1. Fork the project on GitHub by clicking the fork button in the top right, above the "About" section.
2. Clone your forked repository to your local machine using the following command (replace `your username` with your GitHub username):

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/peterportal-client
   ```

3. Navigate into the cloned repository:

   ```bash
   cd peterportal-client
   ```

</Step>
<Step>
### Installing Dependencies

1. Ensure you have Node.js version 18, 20, or 22 LTS installed. If not, consider using nvm for version management.
2. We use pnpm for our package manager. If you don't have pnpm, install it with `npm i -g pnpm`.
3. Install all node dependencies by running:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

</Step>
<Step>
### Setting up Environment Variables

1. Inside the `api` directory, make a copy of the `.env.example` file and name it `.env`
2. Add additional variables as needed for features requiring authentication or database access.
   - You may want an Anteater API key to avoid rate limit issues; see [the Anteater API docs](https://docs.icssc.club/docs/developer/anteaterapi/keys-limits) for more information.
   - To test PeterPortal's search features locally, you'll need an Anteater API key with special search permissions. If you're working on a search-related issue, feel free to contact a project lead in the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/Zu8KZHERtJ) to get a search-enabled key.

</Step>
<Step>
### Switching Branches

Before starting your work, switch to a new branch with a relevant name to your task:

```bash
git checkout -b [branch-name]
```

</Step>
</Steps>

## Commands

<Steps>
<Step>
### Development

To facilitate the development process, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the project's root directory in your terminal.
2. Run the development servers for both the backend and frontend:

   ```bash
   pnpm run dev
   ```

   This command starts the backend Express server and the frontend Next.js dev server. Visit the link printed in the console by Next.js to view the application.

Alternatively, you can run the backend and frontend separately by navigating to their respective directories and running `pnpm run dev` in separate terminal windows.

</Step>
</Steps>

Note: Some steps, such as setting up IAM credentials or accessing certain environment variables, might be restricted to internal contributors. If you're an external contributor, ensure you have the necessary permissions or discuss with a project lead.
