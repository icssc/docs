title: Setting up to contribute to Anteater API
---

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Anteater API!

## ‚úÖ Getting Started

### üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

- For Windows users: A [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) instance
- A Node.js environment
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation), a blazingly fast package manager for Node.js
- [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm?tab=readme-ov-file#install--update-script), a version manager for Node.js
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) for running the local database server, or an already running PostgreSQL server
- Optionally: [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) version 16, for generating database dumps

### üßë‚Äçüíª Setting Up

1. Clone the repository and change into it.

   ```shell
   git clone git@github.com:icssc/anteater-api.git
   cd anteater-api
   ```

2. Make a copy of the `.env.example`.

   ```shell
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

3. Install the dependencies.

   ```shell
   pnpm i
   ```

4. Download the latest version of the database dump [here](https://anteater-api-dump.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/db.sql.gz), and move it into the `packages/db` directory.

   _Optional_: Verify the checksum of the database dump.

   To do this, download the checksum [here](https://anteater-api-dump.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/db.sql.gz.sha256sum), move it into the `packages/db` directory, then run the following command:

   ```shell
   sha256sum -c db.sql.gz.sha256sum
   ```

   If the checksum does not match, the database dump may be corrupt or have been tampered with. You should delete it immediately and try downloading it again.

5. Start the local Postgres database.

   ```shell
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

6. Start the development server.

   ```shell
   pnpm dev
   ```

   The process of database seeding (importing data from the database dump) can take a while. If at first this fails, wait a few minutes before trying again.
