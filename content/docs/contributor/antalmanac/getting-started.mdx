### Steps

<Steps>
    <Step>
        Look through the [issue
        tracker](https://github.com/icssc/AntAlmanac/issues) or [Kanban
        board](https://github.com/icssc/AntAlmanac/wiki/Kanban-Board-Docs) to
        find an open issue (one that hasn't been assigned to anybody) or create
        your own that describes the problem you want to fix.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        [Fork the
        repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo)
        or create a branch if you have the permission to do so.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        [Setup your development environment](#get-setup-to-develop-locally).
    </Step>
    <Step>
        Create a draft pull request with your new branch to track your progress.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        Make any desired changes, commit, and push them. Repeat until the
        selected issue has been addressed.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        Change the pull request from draft to open. If possible, request a
        review from a maintainer.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        Wait for your pull request to get reviewed and address any requested
        changes. Repeat until your pull request is approved.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        Merge your pull request and your changes will appear on the live website
        shortly! ðŸ¥³

## Development Environment

### Pre-requisites

<Steps>
<Step>
Install `Node.js`. This allows you to run JavaScript on your computer (outside of a browser).
This is best done with a version manager that allows you to easily switch between
Node.js versions based on the requirements of different projects.
Try using any of the following.

-   [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) - Node-Version-Manager.
-   [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm) - Fast-Node-Manager.
-   [nvm-widows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows)

If none of those work for any reason, you can defer to your Operating System's
package manager or [the downloads from the official website](https://nodejs.org/en/download).
We will be using the latest LTS version, 20.10.0, lts/iron.

</Step>
<Step>
Install `pnpm`. This is our package manager of choice for this project.
It's responsible for installing, uninstalling, and keeping track of the app's dependencies.

```bash
npm install --global pnpm
```

</Step>
</Steps>

### Developing

<Steps>
<Step>
Clone the AntAlmanac repository or your fork.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/icssc/AntAlmanac.git
```

</Step>
<Step>
Navigate to the root directory and install the dependencies.

```bash
cd AntAlmanac && pnpm install
```

</Step>
<Step>
Start the development server for the frontend.

```bash
pnpm start:aa
```

or

```bash
cd apps/antalmanac && pnpm dev
```

</Step>
<Step>
View the local website at http://localhost:5173. As you make changes to
the React application, those changes will be automatically reflected on
the local website.
</Step>
</Steps>

This is all that is required to develop the frontend project locally.

### But I also want to work with the backend locally...

Typically, you won't need to start the backend server locally
because an active development server is available for usage.

However, if you would like to start both the frontend and the backend locally,
you can run `pnpm start` from the project root.

#### Non-Privileged

When developing as a non-privileged member,
the environment variables won't reflect real credentials to resources such as the database.

The backend should still work, but with limited functionality.
Please request credentials from a project lead if you need them.

<Steps>
    <Step>
        Ensure that you're in the backend project. i.e. `cd apps/backend` from
        the project root.
    </Step>
    <Step>Change the `.env.sample` to `.env`.</Step>
    <Step>Start the server with `pnpm start`.</Step>
</Steps>

#### Privileged

ICSSC Project Committee Members can be given `.env` files with real credentials upon request.
These can be used to access real resources such as DynamoDB, MapBox, etc.

Remove any `.env.*` files in the project root, and insert the `.env` you were given.

### Testing

From the root directory, run `pnpm test`. Or from any directory, run `pnpm -w test`.

## Troubleshooting

### `npm i -g <package>` fails

This is usually an issue with permissions because `npm` is trying to install a Node package
into a globally accessible location like `/bin`, which needs admin permissions to do so.

The best way to resolve this is to install Node via any version manager to properly handle
these sorts of permissions. Here are the different version managers again.

-   [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) - Node-Version-Manager.
-   [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm) - Fast-Node-Manager.
-   [nvm-widows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows)

A more convenient, but less secure way to resolve this is to run the command with admin privileges, e.g with `sudo`.

### The React website doesn't seem to load at all

Try disabling your adblocker.

### I need the env variables for the backend!

An example `.env.sample` is provided and can be used by renaming it to `.env`
If you need real credentials to access the database or private resources,
please contact a project lead.
