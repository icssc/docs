## History

AntAlmanac was created in 2018 by a small group of students under the leadership of [@the-rango](https://github.com/the-rango).  
They formed an AntAlmanac club to recruit other students and work on new features,
so that the website would live on even after its makers graduated.

In 2019, [@devsdevsdevs](https://github.com/devsdevsdevs) took over as AntAlmanac Project Lead and oversaw a massive rewrite of the codebase,
laying the foundation for the AntAlmanac that we know and love today.

In 2020, AntAlmanac was adopted by the ICSSC Projects Committee, which continues to provide funding, marketing, and engineering
to support the growing number of users and open-source developers that make up our AntAlmanac Community.

Since then, the project has continued to evolve and grow with successive generations of projects committee members!
