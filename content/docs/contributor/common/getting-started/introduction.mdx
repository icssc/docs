Thank you for your interest in contributing to ICSSC's projects! We're happy to have you here; after all, open source is a large part of what enables our projects to continue improving.

This article will get you on the path to making an open source contribution to one of our projects. We recognize that you all come from a diversity of backgrounds, and that what works for some of you may not work for others. As such, we will introduce only topics that are directly relevant to your work with ICSSC's projects.

We assume that you have a working knowledge of the following topics:
* A general-purpose programming language (_e.g._, Python, C++, Java)
* HTML and CSS
* Git and GitHub

If you're unsure as to your proficiency in these topics, don't fret! The Internet has many wonderful resources on these subjects, far better and more comprehensive than anything we can pack in a simple documentation page, which is why we chose not to introduce such topics. You can always consult these resources and then come back; we'll still be here.

But if you're ready, read on!
