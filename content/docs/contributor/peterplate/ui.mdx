PeterPlate's frontend -- written in the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) framework.


# App Structure

The web app is contained in apps/next, which should look something like:

<Files>
<Folder name="apps/next" defaultOpen>
  <Folder name=".next" />
  <Folder name="node_modules" />
  <Folder name="public" />
  <Folder name="src" defaultOpen> 
    <Folder name="app" />
    <Folder name="components" />
    <Folder name="context" />
    <Folder name="hooks" />
    <Folder name="utils" />
  </Folder>
</Folder>
</Files>

<Callout>
 A quick aside about `📂node_modules` and `📂public`: 
 - `📂public` is for static data that needs serving, like images.
 - `📂node_modules` is a folder that Node.js automatically generates for the packages used in development.
</Callout>

We will now go into detail about each subdirectory of `📂src`, which 
comprise the whole of the frontend.

## 📂 App
In `📂app`, we use the Next.js page router to establish **pages**, which are web 
pages rendered individually from one another, each with a unique URL.

<Files>
<Folder name="app" defaultOpen>
 <Folder name="about"/>
 <Folder name="events"/>
 <File name="favicon.ico"/>
 <File name="globals.css"/>
 <File name="layout.tsx"/>
 <File name="page.tsx"/>
</Folder>
</Files>

Without going too far into the weeds of the [Next.js page router](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts), 
let's breakdown each element:

- `📂about` & `📂events`: Each folder in Next (if containing a `page.tsx`) 
represents a page. In this case, `/about` and `/events`.
- `favicon.ico`: The favicon of the website (the little image that appears 
next to the tab name).
- `globals.css`: The global stylesheet for all pages, used by tailwindcss.
- `page.tsx`: The homepage for the web app.

## 📂 Components

All of the components used in PeterPlate's web app are defined in 
`📂components`.

PeterPlate extends a lot of the [shad/cn](https://ui.shadcn.com/) library's 
components. As such, you may be better off looking at their documentation to 
implement your own component for PeterPlate.

See the components in this folder for more details on each unique component.

## 📂 Context

All of the [contexts](https://react.dev/learn/passing-data-deeply-with-context)
used in PeterPlate's webapp are defined in `📂context`.

Essentially, a context is a method of passing information between components
without having to **prop drill**, or pass props deeply into children that may
or may not use those props. See the link above for React context information.

## 📂 Hooks

All of the [hooks](https://react.dev/reference/react/hooks) used in PeterPlate's
webapp are defined in `📂hooks`.

See the link above for more information on React hooks.

## 📂 Utils

Functions, types, constants, and other static information/tools used across
PeterPlate's webapp are defined in `📂utils`.

## Defining Your Own Folder

If for some reason you find yourself writing a file that doesn't fit within the
predefined folders above, please reach out to a current PeterPlate lead to figure
out whether a new folder needs to be created for organization. 

# Backend Integration

PeterPlate leverages a tRPC backend, which queries a local Postgres database. 
This database has cron jobs run on it that pull CampusDish data daily and 
weekly for dishes and events.

Most of the tRPC calls in the frontend (as of writing) are performed in the 
`side.tsx` file (Side component). For more information on the tRPC functions, 
check out `docs/Serverless Functions.md`, `docs/tRPC Procedures`, and the 
`packages/api/src` folder.
