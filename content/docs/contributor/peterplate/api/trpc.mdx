import { File, Folder, Files } from "fumadocs-ui/components/files";

Taking a look inside the `./packages/api/src` folder we find something like this:

<Files>
<Folder name="packages/src" defaultOpen>
	<Folder name="dishes"/>
	<Folder name="events"/>
	<Folder name="menus"/>
	<Folder name="periods"/>
	<Folder name="ratings"/>
	<Folder name="restaurants"/>
	<Folder name="stations"/>
	<Folder name="users"/>
</Folder>
</Files>

Each folder corresponds to a set of tRPC procedures that handles one major feature.

Within each subfolder, we find 2-4 `.ts` files that looks something like this:

<Files>
<Folder name="dishes" defaultOpen>
 <File name="router.test.ts"/>
 <File name="router.ts"/>
 <File name="services.test.ts"/>
 <File name="services.ts"/>
</Folder>
</Files>

- The `router.ts` file contains tRPC procedures that exported via the tRPC router.
- The `services.ts` file contains helper functions that are used in the tRPC procedures mentioned above
- The files with extension `.test.ts` contain tests that run when running `turbo test`. See ***creating tests*** for more information.
- For our tRPC functions, we use Zod to define and validate schemas for input variables at runtime.

We will now go into detail about each individual tRPC procedure.
