PeterPlate follows the [code quality practices](/docs/contributor/common/code-quality) 
established by the ICSSC projects board. To maintain a readable, maintainable, 
and extensible codebase, we utilize specific technologies and standards.

## Code Quality
### Biome

Like many other ICSSC projects, we use [Biome.js](https://biomejs.dev/) to 
lint and format our code. We leverage [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) 
to automatically run Biome, which lints and formats your code before it is 
committed and pushed.

#### Rules

Our Biome configuration can be found 
[here](https://github.com/icssc/ZotMeal/blob/main/biome.json). Here's a quick 
overview of our current rules, which are subject to change:

- Indent by two spaces 
- Line width is 80 characters
- Double quote style
- Always use semicolons
- Organize imports

If you would like to suggest a new rule, please reach out to a PeterPlate project lead.

## Commits

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
specification for readable and consistent commit messages.

To ensure compliance, we use [commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org/). Similar to
our code formatting, commit message format is enforced by Husky before each commit.
