title: Serverless Functions
---

import { File, Folder, Files } from "fumadocs-ui/components/files";

As opposed to managing a server backend, PeterPlate uses serverless functions that are ran on-demand in the cloud, with AWS Lambda as our cloud service.

## Cron Jobs

Inside the `./apps/server` folder you will see something like this:

<Files>
<Folder name="apps/server" defaultOpen>
 <Folder name="node_modules" defaultOpen/>
 <Folder name="src" defaultOpen>
  <Folder name="functions" defaultOpen>
    <Folder name="cron"/>
    <Folder name="trpc"/>   
  </Folder>
</Folder>
</Folder>
</Files>

The `src/functions/trpc` directory is used for creating API endpoints for our tRPC functions (for future work). tRPC helps us write APIs with autocomplete and type checking.

Inside the `src/functions/cron` folder we can find:

<Files>
<Folder name="cron" defaultOpen>
 <File name="daily.ts"/>
 <File name="weekly.ts"/>
</Folder>
</Files>

Each of these `.ts` functions corresponds to a specific **cron** job that 
our app performs.

- **Daily**: Fetches the menu from CampusDishAPI for the current day and inserts
it into the database. Runs every day at midnight to ensure the most up to date 
menu information.

- **Weekly**: Fetches all menus from CampusDishAPI for all days at most 2 week 
away from today. Allows users to see future menus for up to 2 week away.

## Server Functions

The main functionality of these jobs can be found in the `./packages/api/src/server` subdirectory.
