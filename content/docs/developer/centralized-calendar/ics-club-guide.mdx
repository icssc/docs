## Introduction

The Centralized Calendar project aims to bring the ICS community closer by making affiliated events easier to discover, and allowing ICSSC to better promote all events. Within ICSSC, this will power our centralized calendar on [studentcouncil.ics.uci.edu](https://studentcouncil.ics.uci.edu), our weekly calendar, weekly newsletter, and Wednesday event shoutouts.

## Steps to Add Your Events

All that's required for the ics-centralized-calendar project is a Google Calendar with your events. Follow these steps to find and share your Google Calendar URL:

Alternatively, internal/board members of ICS Affiliated Clubs can email [icssc@uci.edu](mailto:icssc@uci.edu) to schedule a short meeting to walk through the process.

## FAQ

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="How do event updates work?">
      Once your calendar link is submitted and integrated into the
      ics-centralized-calendar, your events will be automatically updated every
      15 minutes. This ensures that any new events or changes to existing events that
      have not happened yet are reflected in the ics-centralized-calendar quickly.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What event information is required?">

      Every event should have the following fields for best clarity and organization, these fields are usually required by default when creating an event in Google Calendar:

      - **Title:** A clear description of the event.
      - **Location:** The location of the event, or a virtual meeting link in the location field of the event.
      - **Date and Time:** A start and end time that is input through the Google Calendar GUI.
      - **Description:** Include details such as location, agenda, and contact information.

   </Accordion>
   <Accordion title="How can I make changes to my events?">

      Simply update your events in your Google Calendar. The changes will be reflected in during the next update cycle.

   </Accordion>
   <Accordion title="How do I change my club's calendar from the centralized calendar?">
