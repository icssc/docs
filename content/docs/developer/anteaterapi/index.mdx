## FAQ

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="What is an API?">
    API stands for **A**pplication **P**rogramming **I**nterface. In essence, it is a way for programs to communicate with each other using a set of agreed-upon definitions and protocols.

    Anteater API offers both REST and GraphQL APIs, both of which use standard HTTP verbs and status codes, and return structured data using JSON.

  <Accordion title="What is the difference between REST and GraphQL?">
    Anteater API offers both a REST API and a GraphQL API.

    REST stands for **RE**presentational **S**tate **T**ransfer. A REST API has endpoints, each of which represents a resource (e.g. which week of school a certain date is in).
    When a request is made to an endpoint, the server responds with a representation of the state of the resource (e.g. week 4 of winter), hence the name.
    Each HTTP verb (`GET`, `POST`, etc.) represents a different action on the resource being requested.

    GraphQL is a query language for APIs. It is more flexible than REST, since you can query multiple endpoints in the same request and/or selected parts of the data (e.g. when the schedule of classes is posted for a quarter instead of all the important dates).
    However, it does have a slightly higher learning curve, and may require additional work to integrate into your application.

    The correct API to use will almost always depend on your use case; there is no single correct answer.
