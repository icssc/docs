## Request Schema

All requests to the REST API should be made using the base URL https://anteaterapi.com/v2/rest.

## Response Schema

All responses, successful or otherwise, will be sent as JSON. Specific response types can be found on the [API Reference](https://anteaterapi.com/reference).

Successful responses will contain a 200 status code, a response field `ok` equal to `true`, and an associated `data` field.

Erroneous responses will contain a non 200 status code, a response field `ok` equal to `false`, and an associated `message` field.

## Compression

By default, the API compresses all responses over 48 bytes (Gzip) or 50 bytes (Brotli and Zstandard) based on the `Accept-Encoding` header.

If your usecase does not support compressed responses, make sure to send the `Accept-Encoding` header with an empty value. This will ensure that the response will be returned in plaintext.
