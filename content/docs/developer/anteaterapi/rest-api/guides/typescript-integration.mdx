Our API comes fully equipped with an automatically generated OpenAPI specification. This means that with the right tools, you can ensure that your requests are being made with the correct parameters, and that your responses have what you expect - and all without hardcoding any types.

## Getting Started

For this guide, we'll be using [`openapi-typescript`](https://github.com/openapi-ts/openapi-typescript/tree/main/packages/openapi-typescript), an open-source library that consumes OpenAPI specifications and outputs TypeScript type definitions. We'll need to install that first.

Run the following command in your project:

<Tabs items={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]}>
<Tab value="npm">
    ```shell
    npm install -D openapi-typescript
    ```
</Tab>
    <Tab value="yarn">
        ```shell
        yarn add -D openapi-typescript
        ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab value="pnpm">
        ```shell
        pnpm add -D openapi-typescript
        ```
    </Tab>
    </Tabs>
