Our API comes fully equipped with an automatically generated OpenAPI specification. This means that with the right tools, you can ensure that your requests are being made with the correct parameters, and that your responses have what you expect - and all without hardcoding any types.

## Getting Started

For this guide, we'll be using [`openapi-typescript`](https://github.com/openapi-ts/openapi-typescript/tree/main/packages/openapi-typescript), an open-source library that consumes OpenAPI specifications and outputs TypeScript type definitions. We'll need to install that first.

Run the following command in your project:

<Tabs items={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]}>
    <Tab value="npm">
        ```shell
        npm install -D openapi-typescript
        ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab value="yarn">
        ```shell
        yarn add -D openapi-typescript
        ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab value="pnpm">
        ```shell
        pnpm add -D openapi-typescript
        ```
    </Tab>
</Tabs>

Next, you'll want to generate the type definitions, like so:

<Tabs items={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]}>
    <Tab value="npm">
        ```shell
        npx openapi-typescript https://anteaterapi.com/openapi.json --output src/types/generated/anteater-api-types.ts
        ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab value="yarn">
        ```shell
        yarn openapi-typescript https://anteaterapi.com/openapi.json --output src/types/generated/anteater-api-types.ts
        ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab value="pnpm">
        ```shell
        pnpm openapi-typescript https://anteaterapi.com/openapi.json --output src/types/generated/anteater-api-types.ts
        ```
    </Tab>
</Tabs>

I've chosen to output the types into `src/types/generated` for convenience, but you can put the output anywhere that makes sense. Regardless of where you put it, you should add it to your project's `.gitignore` if you're using version control.

Now that you have the type definitions, you can create type aliases for the types you'll be using.
