title: GraphQL API
---

The GraphQL API allows for access to the same resources that can be accessed through the REST API.

You can try using the GraphQL API through [Apollo Sandbox](https://studio.apollographql.com/sandbox/explorer?endpoint=https://anteaterapi.com/v2/graphql) (also available through the navbar), which is a lightweight web-based IDE for GraphQL queries. The Sandbox also contains up-to-date documentation on the different queries available, so you can develop and test all of your queries from within a single page.
