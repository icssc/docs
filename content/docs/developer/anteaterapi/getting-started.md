## REST or GraphQL?

The first choice you need to make when using Anteater API is between our REST API and our GraphQL API.
The correct choice is dependent on your use case and, to some degree, on personal preference.
It is akin to the choice of which programming language to use.

## Authorization

Unlike some other Web APIs, Anteater API does not require API keys or authentication, so you can start using this API immediately.
However, there are still advantages to seeking an API key; learn how to obtain and use one [here](./keys-limits).

## Choosing your stack

If your application is not already fully set up to handle REST or GraphQL, you will need to add to your stack, the list of technologies powering your application.
Examples of parts of your stack include your language (e.g. JavaScript), frameworks (e.g. React), and, most relevantly to Anteater API, your HTTP client.
If using GraphQL, you may also want to select a specialized GraphQL client.

We have a guide on integrating our REST API with TypeScript [here](/docs/developer/anteaterapi/rest-api/guides/typescript-integration).

## Attribution

If you use Anteater API, you **must** follow the [Attribution Policy](./docs/about/attribution-policy).

## Reading documentation

Finally, read the API reference for [REST](https://anteaterapi.com/reference) or try the [GraphQL Sandbox](https://studio.apollographql.com/sandbox/explorer?endpoint=https://anteaterapi.com/v2/graphql).
Both provide exhaustive documentation of what Anteater API offers.

Have fun!
