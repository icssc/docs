## Contributing to Anteater API

Anteater API is free and open-source software (FOSS). The word "free" in this context is as in free speech, though there is also no monetary cost to use Anteater API. This means that everyone can view its source code to see how it works, and everyone is allowed to contribute to Anteater API and/or redistribute its source code.

The Anteater API team also regularly extends invitations to active contributors who are not part of Projects Committee.
