title: Merging AntAlmanac and PeterPortal
description: As of February, two great planning apps are now unified into one platform at AntAlmanac.com

## The Foundation: Two Great Planning Apps

Since its founding in 2018, AntAlmanac has been the go-to application for tens of thousands of
students to plan their courses every quarter.

Seeing that additional course information, such as reviews, past quarter offerings, and long-term course planning
were previously fragmented across various official and unofficial resources, PeterPortal emerged as a way to be the
home for all course and instructor information for UCI courses.

Both the AntAlmanac (Scheduler) and PeterPortal (Planner) platform have evolved over the past few years to become
the best tools our campus offers for setting up individuals for academic success, as we allow for students to
enter in courses/exams they've already taken, plan out every quarter at UCI, and create schedules for each term.

Recently, ICS Student Council developers have made tremendous developments to modernize both apps.
Additionally, AntAlmanac now warns you if you have a missing Lab or Lecture for a course, and PeterPortal
made course and instructor information accessible without leaving the main "roadmap" page.

## The Inspiration: A Sum Greater Than its Two Parts

With two great apps and a thriving organization, we realized that we could create a result that defines the next
decade of course planning at UCI.
AntAlmanac (Scheduler) has amassed a consistent, dependable user base <3, and
PeterPortal (Planner) has much-needed features to cover aspects of course planning that live beyond just the current term.

Because AntAlmanac (Scheduler) and PeterPortal (Planner) are both under ICS Student Council, we have the unique
combination of a large existing user base and the organizational structure to establish long-lasting collaborative
efforts between teams.
This led us to realize that we can enhance the course planning experience by creating experiences
that persist between the previously separate apps.

As of February 1st, 2026, PeterPortal will henceforth be known as *AntAlmanac Planner*, while AntAlmanac's quarter-planning
capability will remain unchanged as *AntAlmanac Scheduler*.
Throughout this merge, we also aim to empower our developers to
collaborate across teams and on initiatives that help students plan courses in both the short term and the long term.
If any of this interests you, we'd love to hear your ideas, questions, and feedback in the [ICSSC Projects Discord Server](https://discord.gg/MxZqH4Zz4b).

We've set up shared infrastructure to deploy both Scheduler and Planner under https://antalmanac.com, and we look forward
to enabling more integrations down the line.

## What This Means for You

As of today, you only need one login to access both Scheduler and Planner, and
in the future, you will be able to:

- Filter search results in Scheduler to exclude courses you've taken in previous quarters of your (Planner) Roadmap.
- Import entire quarters from a Planner Roadmap into Scheduler
- Faster access to course and instructor information

However, as we're actively developing both platforms, we'd love to hear your thoughts!
You can contact our Projects Committee Chairs, team leads, and developer teams in the [ICSSC Projects Discord Server](https://discord.gg/MxZqH4Zz4b)
&mdash; and we're more than happy to work with you to shape the future of course planning!
